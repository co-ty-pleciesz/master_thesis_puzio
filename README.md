# Investigating Brain Information Transfer During Intention Decoding Using Multivariate Transfer Entropy

Repository purpose is to keep all programs, articles, tools and informations used to write my master thesis.






## Toolkit that I use

 - [The Information Dynamics Toolkit xl (IDTxl)](https://github.com/pwollstadt/IDTxl)

## Theoritical background

 - [Theoretical Introduction to IDTxl toolkit ](https://github.com/pwollstadt/IDTxl/wiki/Theoretical-Introduction)
 - [Information theory - Joseph Lazier lecture on youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOfPLLxr5gsVLSlmzcMnsFANb-uWkArby&si=CmDHGDc9H7kVCQrs)

   This playlist presents video lectures from a course on using information theory for analysing complex systems, with particular focuses on:
    1. Measures of information dynamics: how information is processed in complex systems, including measures of information storage and transfer;
    2. Empirical data analysis using the JIDT open-source software - http://github.com/jlizier/jidt (which is java version of what i use)

## Other research that uses this toolkit

 - [Brain Connectivity Analysis for EEG-Based Face Perception Task](https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169254368)
 - [Revealing non-trivial information structures in aneural biological tissues via functional connectivit](https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171650046)





## Key Terminology: 
* `Multivariate Transfer Entropy` - Multivariate Transfer Entropy (MTE) is a measure of directional information flow between multiple variables in a dynamic system, extending the classical Transfer Entropy (TE) to account for multivariate interactions. Unlike pairwise TE, MTE quantifies the amount of information transferred from one or more source variables to one or more target variables, while conditioning on the state of other variables in the system, thereby capturing more complex dependencies and interactions.
